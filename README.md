We are a group of three students of ‘Creative Electronics’,
a Beng Electronic Engineering 4th year module at the University of Malaga, School of Telecommunication.

in addition we had read about the BotaniCalls project so we decided to make our plant smart. 
In this link we explain how we have done it:
